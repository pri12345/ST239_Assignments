# Global rules to be read for every prompt.


<critical> 

### 1. Introduction:

1.1. The user needs you to code his Data Science assignment. You need to mantain the same coding style throughout the whole file (@workspace.py) and markdown file (@md_text_workspace.md).

1.2. The instructions for the assignment are available in PDF and Markdown format (@MD_assignment_2_instructions.md).

1.3. You will only take one SUB question at a time (e.g. question 1.a) ).

1.4. The user is using a .venv to for this project. you can see more details in the folder @.venv , and use this virtual environment to install all imports. Prompt the user if there is any complication, but do not add imports to the global path.

### 2. Styling and coding guidelines:

2.1. There folder @Past_Examples is full of jupyter notebook examples (.ipynb), read them and use the coding style (methods, allignment, tabulations, printing style, etc.) as inspiration.

2.2. Moreover, there is a full example of a previous assignment in @First_Assignment, particularly @Assignment1.ipynb. You can see the set of instructions for this assignment at @MD_instructions.md . You should take the libraries used and formatting as inspiration as well.

### 3. Procedure:

3.1. The user will ask you to work on a specific sub-question. Since the final file will be of .ipynb format. Since it's harder for you to edit these files, we will use @workspace.py for the code, and @md_text_workspace.md for all introductions, comments, and discussions. 

3.2. The code in @workspace.py should be separated by sub-question. All imports will go at the top, no imports in between. Comment above python code that is not "straight-forward" or is the "main part" of the question.

3.3. The markdown text in @md_text_workspace.md should also be separated by subquestion. You should follow the general format of past examples/assignments (Introduction of question, then discussion according to what the instructions say to evaluate).
